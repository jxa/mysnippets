snippets created for use with the yasnippet emacs library
here is what I have in my .emacs file to load yasnippet's default snippets
followed by mynippets

(require 'yasnippet)
(yas/initialize)
(yas/load-directory "~/.emacs.d/extern/yasnippet/snippets/")
(setq yas/root-directory "~/.emacs.d/extern/mysnippet/")
(yas/load-directory yas/root-directory)
